====================

problem1
--------

Python backing to maths for the Finite Elements coursework. I have one matrix M that represents factors that multiply 
T (temperatures) and another that represents a Vector on the RHS, f_lb. Equation is M * T = f_lb. M and f_lb only contain
known parameters, so to find T simply calculate M.I * f_lb.

Resulting temperatures are then plotted.
